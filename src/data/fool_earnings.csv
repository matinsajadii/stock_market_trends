0,NDAQ,Why Nasdaq Stock Fell 9.6% This Week,"Jun 16, 2023",12:34PM,2023-10-14 22:52:56.797171,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/06/16/why-nasdaq-stock-fell-96-this-week/,"
What happened
Nasdaq (NDAQ 0.10%) had a bumpy ride this week, its share price plummeting 9.6% as of Friday morning at 9:30 a.m. ET, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Nasdaq was trading at about $52 per share at the market open on Friday, down about 15% year to date. 
It dropped in what turned out to be a solid week for the markets as the S&P 500 had gained 3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had climbed 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite had jumped 3.9% this week on Friday at the opening bell.
So what
Nasdaq, the company that runs the Nasdaq stock exchange, made a big splash this week, announcing on Monday that it was acquiring Adenza, a software company that offers risk management and regulatory compliance services for companies. In other words, it tracks companies' spending and makes sure they're in compliance. 

Nasdaq bought Adenza from software company Thoma Bravo for $10.5 billion, making this the biggest acquisition (in terms of price) in the company's history. That turned out to be the rub, as some analysts and investors thought Nasdaq, which already has significant long-term debt, overpaid for this company. 
The move sparked a sell-off, and the share price dropped some 10% after the news came out, down to below $50 per share.




Now what
Purchase price aside, the acquisition itself is part of Nasdaq's strategy to expand its offerings beyond the stock exchange to give itself multiple revenue streams and provide some stable income. The stock exchange business can be pretty volatile.
""This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a leading software company that enhances Nasdaq's position at the heart of the global financial system,"" said Adena Friedman, chair and CEO of Nasdaq.
Adenza is expected to generate about $590 million in revenue this year, with 15% organic revenue growth and 18% annual recurring revenue growth. Also, the company has a loyal clientele, boasting a 98% gross retention rate with 80% recurring revenue. It should boost revenue for Nasdaq's Solutions Businesses from 71% of total revenue to 77%. 
While the debt is a concern, this looks like a good business and a strategic fit, and with the extra revenue along with the already high margins and operating cash flow, Nasdaq should be able to handle it and prosper. This is actually a pretty good time to consider buying Nasdaq stock, as the forward price-to-earnings ratio is down to 18 after the sell-off.

1,NDAQ,Why Nasdaq Stock Was Falling Today,"Jun 12, 2023",4:11PM,2023-10-14 22:52:58.095231,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/06/12/why-nasdaq-stock-was-falling-today/,"
What happened
Typically, when investors talk about Nasdaq (NDAQ 0.10%), they are referring to the Nasdaq Composite index, or perhaps the abridged Nasdaq-100, but Nasdaq is also a company that runs the eponymous exchange, and today its stock was tumbling.
As of 3:12 p.m. ET, the stock was down 11.3% on news that it would buy financial software company Adenza from Thoma Bravo for $10.5 billion.

So what
The deal would be the biggest ever for the stock market exchange, and the company argued that it accelerates its ""strategic vision to become the trusted fabric of the world's financial system."" 
The deal is in keeping with CEO Adena Friedman's aim to transition the company from an exchange operator, which is sensitive to trading volumes, to a more tech-forward company with steady revenue streams. 
Adenza provides risk-management and regulatory software for the financial services sector, and the company is expected to bring in $590 million this year, giving it a price-to-sales ratio of about 18. It's also expected to deliver 15% organic revenue growth and a 58% adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin. 




The deal with Thoma Bravo, which is a private equity firm known for buying software companies, is a cash-and-stock deal that will give it a 14.9% stake in Nasdaq. 
Now what
The market's reaction seemed to indicate that investors thought Nasdaq was overpaying for the company, and it may also be skeptical of the deal regardless of the price tag. 
Adenza resulted from the merger of two software companies, Calypso and Axiom, that Thoma Bravo had previously acquired. It's unclear how much Thoma Bravo paid for them, but the deal is likely a win for the PE firm. 
At this point, it seems too early to judge the wisdom of the acquisition, but at roughly 40% of Nasdaq's market cap, it's a steep price for the financial services company. 




The deal will dilute shareholders and add to the company's debt burden, but Nasdaq expects it to be accretive to earnings after two years.

2,NDAQ,What Is a Stock Ticker?,"Apr 19, 2023",5:40PM,2023-10-14 22:53:01.046605,https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/stock-ticker/,"

Stock ticker symbols are codes that represent publicly traded companies in the stock market. Although a stock's ticker, strictly speaking, is distinct from its ticker symbol, most investors use the term stock ticker as shorthand for its ticker symbol. The ticker itself is the constantly updating stream of information about a stock, and the ticker symbol is its code, consisting of between one and four letters.




Image source: The Motley Fool.



Stock ticker codes or symbols were originally created to shorten publicly traded company names on ticker tape printed by brokerage houses. Today, a stock ticker helps you search for a specific stock online and perhaps make a trade using your brokerage's website.Although most stock ticker symbols are composed of three or four letters, some older companies have one- or two-letter tickers. Mutual funds and many foreign companies have five-letter ticker symbols. Most ticker symbols are either abbreviations of companies' names -- such as ABNB for Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) -- or somehow related to the company, such as Petco's (NASDAQ:WOOF) clever choice of WOOF.


How to read stock ticker symbolsReading a stock ticker is usually pretty easy. Let's use Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) as an example. The company's legal name, which is the same name the company uses to file documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is Netflix, Inc. The stock exchange it trades on is the Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ), and the streaming entertainment company's ticker symbol is NFLX.This information, taken together, and with the addition of the stock price and information about its recent movement, is the stock's ticker -- at least in the strictest sense. ""NFLX"" is customarily referred to as the company's ticker despite being only the symbol representing Netflix on the Nasdaq exchange.Types of stock tickersEach stock exchange sets the rules for the length and format of its stock ticker symbols, which is why variations in stock tickers exist. As previously noted, most stock tickers are three or four letters, and some stock exchanges allow numbers. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) allows as many as four letters, and the Nasdaq allows up to five.Some stock ticker symbols also include modifiers, which are additional (usually fifth) letters or letters following periods in the symbols. Modifiers can be used to express the type of security, such as a mutual fund; the type of stock, such as a preferred stock; or the class of stock, which denotes shareholder privileges.Companies create different classes of shares to allow the management team to hold a higher percentage of the vote than they do equity in the company. This way, investors still receive something for their investment, but management maintains control over decisions.





Stock ticker examples While every stock exchange has its own rules for ticker symbols, it's helpful to understand broadly how stock tickers can appear. Most of the variation is caused by the modifiers, which below are explained from A to Z:A: Denotes the Class A version of a stock, which confers certain rights and privileges to shareholders that may not be available to holders of other classes of a company's stock.B: Denotes the Class B version of a stock, which generally confers fewer rights and privileges than Class A stock, or it may be priced to be affordable to individual investors.C: Indicates that a company no longer meets the listing requirements of a stock exchange but has not yet been delisted.D: Signifies newly issued shares or a reverse stock split. E: Assigned to companies that are delinquent in filing with the SEC.F: Reserved for companies listed on foreign exchanges.G: For first convertible bonds, which can be converted into shares of stock at a specified stock price. First convertible bond owners are paid first in the event of asset liquidation or bankruptcy.H: For second convertible bonds, which also are convertible into stock. Second convertible bond owners are paid second in the event of liquidation or bankruptcy.I: Denotes third convertible bonds, which are convertible into stock and whose owners are paid third and last in the event of bankruptcy.J: Used by the Nasdaq exchange to denote, in relation to shareholder votes, which stocks have voting rights.K: Used by the Nasdaq exchange in the same context to denote the absence of shareholder voting rights.L: Something of a catch-all variation and used differently by different exchanges.M: For fourth-class preferred shares, which are preferred shares that have the fourth-highest dividend payment priority in the event of a cash shortfall for a company. Preferred shares are a type of fixed-income security that pays a guaranteed dividend, unlike common shares.N: Denotes third-class preferred shares, for which guaranteed dividends are paid ahead of fourth-class preferred shares.O: Signifies second-class preferred shares, which have the second-strongest guarantee of the dividend being paid.P: For first-class preferred shares, which have the most liquidity because the dividend guarantee is the strongest.Q: Indicates a company that has filed for bankruptcy protection.R: Denotes a stock rights offering, which is designed to enable a company to issue additional shares of stock without diluting existing shareholders' ownership percentages. Stock rights allow existing shareholders only to buy new shares of a stock at a lower price than new buyers.S: Shares of beneficial interest, which are a security type that confers the right to the income generated by an asset without transferring ownership of the asset itself.T: Denotes stock warrants or rights. Warrants are a lot like stock options.U: Used for new issues and typically groups shares of a stock, along with any warrants or rights that have been attached.V: Denotes stock that is trading before it has been formally issued. The Nasdaq exchange permits some institutional investors to buy stocks ""when issued"" that will soon have their initial public offerings, or IPOs. The trade is made official after the IPO.W: For warrants to buy a stock. Note that sometimes WS will be used instead of W, but there is no difference.X: Used by all mutual funds.Y: Indicates the stock is an American depositary receipt (ADR), a type of security that allows foreign stocks to trade on U.S. exchanges. The company still trades on a foreign exchange, with the ADR converting the stock's foreign value to dollars for U.S. investors.Z: Another letter that is used differently by different exchanges.A few other modifiers are:OB: Short for over-the-counter (OTC) bulletin board, which denotes a stock that trades on the OTC market.PK: Stands for pink sheet, synonymous with OTC. Both pink sheet and OTC stocks do not trade on major exchanges but via broker networks (that formerly relied on actual pink sheets of paper).SC: Denotes a company trading on the Nasdaq Capital Markets exchange, which is smaller and has less stringent listing requirements.Note that many of these modifiers apply only to quotations directly from stock exchanges, and you are not likely to see them as a nonprofessional investor. Here are some of the stock ticker modifiers you are likely to see:

A


For Class A shares.

3,NDAQ,The Bear Takes a Bite Out of Nasdaq Shares,"Jan 28, 2023",5:45AM,2023-10-14 22:53:02.327112,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/01/28/the-bear-takes-a-bite-out-of-nasdaq/,"
The past year has been difficult for the stock and bond markets, as anyone who tracked the performance of their 401(k) can attest. The bear market also was a negative for the companies that own the stock exchanges.
Over the past year, Nasdaq (NDAQ 0.10%) has taken steps to reduce its reliance on services that rise and fall with the stock market. The stock was rocked by disappointing earnings, however the company laid out how some of its new initiatives will reduce its correlation with markets. 

Image source: Getty Images.

Nasdaq focuses on serving the capital markets and financial industries. The company offers data and analytics as well as software and services. It recently reorganized into three operating segments: market platforms, capital access platforms, and anti-financial crime. The market platforms segment includes trading and market technology. The capital access platform segment includes listing services, indexes, and workflow solutions including environmental and social governance (ESG). Finally, the anti-financial crime segment offers a software solution that helps financial institutions monitor and detect fraud and money laundering.

The ups and downs of the stock market are the biggest drivers of performance
Market platforms accounts for just over two-thirds of Nasdaq's revenue and it is tied to the stock market's fortunes. Unfortunately for the company, trading volume usually declines in a bear market. During a bull market, investor appetite for initial public offerings (IPOs) usually increases. Index revenue, which is based on assets under management, also rises and falls with the fortunes of the stock market. This is one of the reasons Nasdaq is focusing on diversifying away from businesses that are tightly tied to market movement. 
Nasdaq is taking steps to diversify its offerings
The anti-financial crime segment is by far the smallest segment; however, it is experiencing much faster growth than the other divisions. In the fourth quarter, the segment increased revenue by 21%, and operating margin increased from 25% to 32%. Financial crime is a major focus of regulators and banks, which run the risk of running afoul of regulators if they have insufficient policies and procedures to detect and address financial fraud and money laundering. Nasdaq sees this as an $18 billion total addressable market, which it has only begun to penetrate. This segment is expected to grow at above-market rates for the foreseeable future and Nasdaq sees it as a core growth area. 




Workflow and insights includes the recent acquisition of Metrio, an ESG data and reporting platform. ESG continues to be an important consideration for many investors and Nasdaq sees this as a big growth area. 
Disappointing numbers, but the company should be a steady performer going forward
Nasdaq's earnings did disappoint, and Wall Street was unhappy with the company's forecast for a 5% rise in operating costs next year. That said, revenue rose 7.8% although earnings per share fell from $0.51 to $0.48. The company did hike the quarterly dividend as well. Nasdaq didn't give much to work with in terms of outlook. While anti-financial crime and ESG represent areas that should grow regardless of the stock market, the overall business of stock trading, data, technology, and issuer services will drive the business. Nasdaq still has a strong competitive moat and has little competition aside from Intercontinental Exchange. 
Nasdaq is trading at 22.4 times expected 2023 earnings per share. This is a reasonable multiple for a market-leading company that has a competitive moat and very little competition. The dividend yield of 1.4% isn't likely to attract income investors. Still, Nasdaq is a steady performer with some interesting growth possibilities, though its overall performance still depend on the stock market.

4,NDAQ,1 Under-the-Radar Growth Stock to Buy and Hold,"Aug 3, 2022",8:41AM,2023-10-14 22:53:03.882996,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/08/03/under-the-radar-growth-stock-buy-and-hold-nasdaq/,"
When you think of Nasdaq (NDAQ 0.10%), you probably think of the exchange or its indices, which are the leading benchmarks for technology and growth stocks. However, Nasdaq Inc. is also a company that itself trades on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. And while the exchange is a household name for investors, Nasdaq's stock largely flies under the radar compared to other tech stocks.
The stock is, in fact, beating the exchange it owns, trading down about 14% year-to-date, while the Nasdaq Composite is off 20% as of Aug. 1. Here is why Nasdaq, the stock, stands out on Nasdaq, the exchange.
A 3-for-1 stock split to take effect this month
Nasdaq is currently trading at about $180 per share, but that will soon change as the company has been approved for a 3-for-1 stock split. That means that every shareholder as of Aug. 12 will get two additional shares for each already owned, but each share will be worth about $60. The split will take place after the markets close Aug. 26 and start trading on Aug. 29. 
As Nasdaq President and CEO Adena Friedman explained on the first-quarter earnings conference call, the split invites more investors to own shares because the entry price is lower, and it creates greater liquidity and more trading on the exchange ""as opposed to through these fractional share offerings are all off-exchange."" And because Nasdaq earns revenue when shares are traded in the U.S., stock splits are good for the company, because they generally encourage more trading. 

The market has reacted positively to the news as the stock is up roughly 12.2% since the second-quarter earnings report came out on July 20, along with the announcement of the final approvals and dates for the stock split. In the month of July, Nasdaq was a market mover, up 18.6%. 




Nasdaq has diverse revenue streams
News of the stock split aside, Nasdaq posted solid earnings in the second quarter. Overall, total revenue was up 10% year over year to $1.5 billion while net revenue was up about 6% to $893 million. Non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share was up 9% year over year to $2.07 -- not counting a net gain on a divestiture a year ago.
While the exchange business is a major revenue generator, what makes Nasdaq an attractive stock is it has four different revenue streams -- with multiple different types of revenue. And all four business segments saw year-over-year revenue increases in the most recent quarter. 
The four segments are:

Market services, which include revenue from trading on the exchanges;
Investment intelligence, which includes market data and intelligence, as well as licensing its indices;
Market technology, which offers technology solutions for institutional investors in the areas of trading and settlement, anti-financial crime, among others; and
Corporate platforms, which include index listing, as well as investor relations and ESG (environmental, social, governance) services.

Nasdaq earns revenue from transaction fees related to trading within the exchanges as well as listing fees for being on the indices. This is recurring revenue and it helps stabilize the bottom line. Another recurring revenue source is subscriptions within its software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings in its market technology business. On the second-quarter earnings call, Friedman said SaaS revenue grew 12% year over year to $679 million in the second quarter and now makes up 35% of recurring revenue. ""The consistent growth we're seeing in our recurring revenue segments provides a powerful starting point for our overall performance,"" she said. 




Nasdaq has focused on building out its SaaS and recurring cash flow through these various business segments to not only create more growth opportunities but also to navigate a variety of market cycles -- including bear markets. The growth in these segments has also allowed Nasdaq to improve its operating margin to its highest level since 2016 at 26% and boost its quarterly free cash flow to $570 million in the first quarter -- the highest ever. 
With these growth engines, its capital strength, its dominance among index providers, and its soon-to-be lower entry price, Nasdaq looks like a solid long-term buy right now.

5,NDAQ,Generate Passive Income as This Dividend Payer Eyes a Stock Split,"Aug 3, 2022",5:45AM,2023-10-14 22:53:04.966246,https://www.fool.com/investing/2022/08/03/generate-passive-income-as-this-dividend-payer-eye/,"
Since 1980, businesses that have announced stock splits have nearly tripled the returns of the S&P 500 Index over the following 12 months. This figure is pretty shocking, as technically nothing changes within a corporation or about its value when it goes through a split.
So what's going on?
Often, stock splits make high-priced shares more accessible to individual investors -- though that impact is diminishing now that brokers widely offer the option of buying fractional shares. Occasionally, the maneuver is used to position a company to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which requires a lower share price due to its price-weighted formula.
My highly unscientific theory on why stock splits tend to outperform is that most companies ""in need of"" a stock split because their prices have soared are proven winners -- and winners tend to keep winning. 
This idea brings me to Nasdaq (NDAQ 0.10%) and its nearly 700% share price gain over the past decade. It will undergo a 3-for-1 stock split in late August. It, too, could keep on winning -- thanks to its dividend (which at the current share price yields less than 1%), its slim payout ratio of 29%, and its quickly budding software-as-a-service (SaaS) business. 





SaaS stability
While cash equity and equity derivatives trading still accounts for the largest single slice of Nasdaq's sales, its collection of non-trading segments now provides 74% of total revenue. Consisting of Market Technology, Investment Intelligence, and Corporate Platforms segments, the non-trading portion of Nasdaq's business (collectively called its Solutions segment) is a bit of a hidden gem.
Of the revenue generated across the Solutions segment and the non-trading portion of its Market Services segment, around 70% comes from recurring revenue. This is quietly beneficial for Nasdaq because recurring revenue tends to be incredibly sticky and predictable, coming from customers with subscription contracts.
This stability is critical to Nasdaq as it helps balance out the volume-driven lumpiness around its trading revenue and the broader macroeconomic issues that affect its listings business. Nasdaq's annual recurring revenue has grown by an average of 11% a year since 2017, bringing consistent growth to formerly volatile revenue figures. 
Best yet for investors, management expects SaaS sales to account for 40% to 50% of annual recurring revenue by 2025. These SaaS sales should help improve operating margins over time as Nasdaq develops long-term relationships with customers and brings its portfolio of financial services to bear on a land-and-expand strategy.




Since 2016, when SaaS sales amounted to 21% of annual recurring revenue, their share has risen to 35%. Consider the following chart, highlighting how important these growing SaaS sales are.

NDAQ Profit Margin data by YCharts
While five years is a relatively small sample size over the company's history, this chart shows the power of Nasdaq's ongoing transformation. Having widened its profit margin to nearly 20% while seeing its return on equity double to almost 17%, Nasdaq has become a passive income powerhouse for investors.
Passive income potential
An investor who bought Nasdaq 10 years ago when it first started making dividend payments would now be collecting a yield of 10% on their original cost basis, thanks to the company's track record of payout increases.

Since dividend-growing stocks with payout ratios below 50% have historically outperformed the S&P 500 Index, Nasdaq's blend of steady top-line growth and increasing returns to shareholders should be a winning combination over the long haul.
Despite rough macroeconomic conditions, in Q2, Nasdaq's net revenue grew by 6% year over year, and its non-GAAP earnings per share rose by 9%. These results highlight the resilience of its recurring revenue and its SaaS focus, which compensated for a drop in trading revenue.
Thanks to this diversification and the steady growth provided by its Solutions segment, Nasdaq should be a stock-splitting winner that keeps on winning, generating increasing levels of dividend income along the way.

6,CDNS,Investing in a Quantum Computing ETF,"Jul 3, 2023",7:26PM,2023-10-14 22:53:09.798227,https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/ai-stocks/quantum-computing-etf/,"

Quantum computer technology has made great strides in recent years and is becoming increasingly affordable to develop and build. That's good news because the demand for more powerful computing is ballooning with the expansion of cloud computing, the proliferation of digital devices, and the dawn of the AI era.Quantum computing could emerge as a key technology and investment trend in the decades ahead. But because it's still in its infancy, the best way to invest in the industry could be via a quantum computing ETF.

What is quantum computing?What is quantum computing?Quantum computers make use of superposition, which is the phenomenon that occurs at the subatomic scale where particles have no clearly defined state.Harnessing the power of superposition dramatically accelerates computing speed and can help solve complex problems in the real world, such as coordinating logistics or simulating the structure of pharmaceutical products.The advent of cloud computing has helped expand access to quantum computers, delivering computations to researchers via an internet connection.





Leading companies in quantum computingLeading companies in quantum computingSince quantum computing is still being researched and developed, there are few publicly traded company stocks solely dedicated to the technology. However, there are some well-known businesses funneling lots of research dollars into quantum computing. A few newly public pure-play stocks have hit the market during the last couple of years, too.The best quantum computing stocks include: Microsoft (MSFT  -1.04%): The software giant has various research labs devoted to quantum computing and offers quantum computing services via the cloud on Azure.  Nvidia (NVDA  -3.16%): The top semiconductor designer for AI has also been working on a quantum computing software stack, as well as a hybrid quantum computing unit in partnership with start-up Quantum Machines.Honeywell (HON  -0.21%): Honeywell developed its own quantum computer but merged its Honeywell Quantum Solutions unit with start-up Cambridge Quantum Computing to create a new business called Quantinuum focused on the nascent industry.IBM (IBM  -1.97%): The legacy tech firm offers quantum computing and accompanying software and has a community of more than 210 partner companies and research institutions.IonQ (IONQ  -6.05%): Start-up IonQ merged with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) dMY Technology Group III in 2021 and is building a network of quantum computers accessible via cloud computing.

Benefits of Defiance Quantum ETFBenefits of Defiance Quantum ETFIt offers well-diversified exposure to the quantum computing industry before it gains widespread commercialization.The ETF invests in established semiconductor and software technology companies not solely dependent on the development of quantum computing, which could provide some stability to the fund's performance over time.In its short history, the Defiance Quantum ETF has doubled in value, although this is attributable to growth in the technology sector overall rather than quantum computing specifically.Opportunities for quantum computing investingOpportunities for quantum computing investingAlthough there is only one quantum computing ETF available at the moment, there are other opportunities available for investors wanting to bet on the technology. IonQ was the first publicly traded pure-play stock in quantum technology. Bear in mind this company is a startup, though. It generates little in the way of revenue and currently loses money.Likewise, the merger between Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum Computing -- now known as Quantinuum -- offers another opportunity for investors to get in on the movement early. Honeywell is the majority owner of Quantinuum.Related investing topics

Artificial intelligence (AI) -- a computing system that attempts to imitate the way the human mind processes information and solves problems -- has been around for decades. But a new wave of AI is sweeping the tech world, driven by generative AI services like ChatGPT.
Companies across all industries see the potential to supercharge their performance if they put these new computing systems to work and are investing in new projects accordingly. 
Behind every AI system is a powerful semiconductor, so chip stocks have rightly attracted a lot of attention in recent months. But before these building blocks of tech are manufactured and deployed into supercomputers that power generative AI, they need to be designed. That's why Cadence Design Systems (CDNS -0.77%) is worth getting acquainted with right now. 

A top AI software stock for the AI era
Shares of Cadence Design have been hot, up over 30% so far in 2023 and largely bucking the bear market with a 54% return since the start of 2021 (versus a -5% return for the Nasdaq Composite Index over that same time). What's going on?  
Cadence is a semiconductor company, but it's also a software business. Its electronic design automation (EDA) software suite is absolutely critical to designing semiconductors. Think of it like Autodesk's (NASDAQ: ADSK) AutoCAD but for chips and computing systems. And as the name EDA would imply (the ""automation"" in electronic design automation), this software provider has AI services embedded throughout its software portfolio. Just a few product examples are:





Tensilica AI: chip designs for intelligent processing in Internet of Things (IoT) devices that a company can license from Cadence and customize to their needs. This is a similar business model to ARM Holdings.


Allegro X AI: computing system design software featuring generative AI to assist an engineer with chip layout on a circuit board.  


Verisium: a suite of apps powered by AI to help with computing system debugging, verification of hardware and software integration, and managing software code.  

The real beauty of a company like Cadence is its stable revenue growth. Its business model is primarily subscription based, which removes much of the booms and busts inherent with other semiconductor stocks. Booms and busts are common in a manufacturing industry, which is ultimately what the semiconductor space is.
The result isn't the fastest-growing chip stock out there, but a steady expansion of revenue and robust free cash flow generation are key features of this investment. 



Data by YCharts.
A top AI stock, but at what price?
With AI chip and computing system design emerging as a top tech trend, Cadence obviously has a lot to gain in the years ahead.




But there is a drawback, and that comes in the form of a very high premium valuation. Shares of the design software company currently trade for 67 times trailing-12-month earnings per share or 55 times trailing-12-month free cash flow. Clearly, the market has caught on to Cadence's fantastic positioning for the AI era.  
Cadence does expect to grow revenue by about 14% in 2023 ($4.03 billion to $4.07 billion is management's forecast range) and for a slight increase in profit margins (adjusted operating margin of 41% to 42%, compared to 40% in 2022). Still, it's a high premium.
EDA software peer Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS) trades for only 37 times trailing-12-month free cash flow, is growing sales at a similar pace, and is leaning into profit margin expansion as a top priority in the years ahead.  
Even so, Cadence Design looks like a solid investment for the decade ahead as it could enjoy gradual expansion along with its myriad of chip design, computing systems, and big tech customers.




If you choose to buy, I'll caution against taking too large a position. As has been the case the last six months, this stock is a dollar-cost average position for me, as is Synopsys. I'm starting small, but with big potential going forward from the AI movement, Cadence is worth keeping tabs on after getting 2023 started on the right foot.

Shares of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS -0.77%) fell 5.5% in after-hours trading on Monday, after the provider of design solutions for the electronics industry released its first-quarter 2023 report. 
The stock's decline is attributable to management's second-quarter guidance coming in lighter than Wall Street had expected for both revenue and earnings. On the other hand, the first quarter's top and bottom lines beat the analyst consensus estimates.

Data source: Cadence Design Systems. GAAP = generally accepted accounting principles. YOY = year over year.
Wall Street was looking for adjusted EPS of $1.25 on revenue of $1.01 billion. So the company exceeded both expectations. It also met its own revenue guidance ($1 billion to $1.02 billion) and surpassed its adjusted EPS guidance ($1.23 to $1.27).      
Cadence Design generated cash of $267 million running its operations during the quarter, down 21% from the year-ago period. It ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $917 million and long-term debt of $648 million.




What happened with Cadence Design in the quarter? 

Recurring revenue accounted for 80% of total revenue.
Revenue mix by product category was 20% custom integrated circuit (IC) design and simulation, 25% digital IC design and sign-off, 32% functional verification (including emulation and prototyping hardware), 11% intellectual property (IP), and 12% system design and analysis. Relative to the year-ago period, the verification category gained 4 percentage points, while the other categories each lost 2 percentage points. On the earnings call, CEO Anirudh Devgan said that demand for hardware was ""broad-based, with particular strength seen in the aerospace and defense and automotive segments.""
It ended the quarter with a backlog of $5.4 billion.


What the CEO had to say
Here's what Devgan had to say in the earnings release: 

Cadence delivered strong results for the first quarter driven by our consistent execution and continued momentum in the core EDA [electronic design automation] and System Design & Analysis businesses. With the recent introductions of Virtuoso Studio and Allegro X AI, we now have an unmatched ""chip to package to board to systems"" Generative AI portfolio underpinned by our differentiated JedAI platform and delivering unprecedented quality of results and productivity benefits.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has recently become a hot topic due in large part to the popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT. In simple terms, generative AI ""enables users to quickly generate new content based on a variety of inputs,"" in the words of tech giant Nvidia, which is a key player in this space. Inputs and outputs to foundational models can include text, images, sounds, or other types of data. 
Guidance
For the second quarter of 2023, management issued the following outlook: 

Revenue of $960 million to $980 million, which would equate to growth of 12% to 14% year over year. 
Adjusted EPS of $1.15 to $1.19, which would equate to growth of 6% to 10%.

Going into the report, Wall Street was modeling for second-quarter revenue of $1.01 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.25. So guidance came up short of estimates on both counts.




For the full year, the company updated its outlook:

Revenue of $4.03 billion to $4.07 billion, up from prior guidance of $4 billion to $4.06 billion. This would represent annual growth of 13% to 14%.
Adjusted EPS of $4.96 to $5.04, up from prior guidance of $4.90 to $5. This would represent growth of 16% to 18%.
The company expects to use about 50% of its free cash flow to repurchase shares.  

Going into the report, Wall Street was modeling for full-year 2023 revenue of $4.04 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.98. So, at the midpoint of the ranges, guidance for both the top and bottom lines came in higher than analysts had been projecting.
Worth a spot on your watch list
This snippet from Devgan's remarks on the earnings call summarizes why Cadence stock is worth considering buying, or at least worth watching: 

Along with AI, other generational trends such as hyperscale computing, 5G, and the digital transformation across multiple verticals continue to propel thriving design activity across semi[conductor] and systems companies, creating rich market opportunities for our differentiated end-to-end EDA [electronic design automation], IP [intellectual property] and systems solutions.

Shares were trading at 42.6 times expected 2023 earnings based on their price at Monday's close. That's somewhat pricey for shares of a company that's expected to grow 2023 earnings 16% to 18%.




That said, high-quality stocks rarely come cheap. If you like the stock but consider its valuation too rich, you might consider watching it and scooping up shares following a price correction.

11,CDNS,This 1 Semiconductor Stock Could Be A Best Buy Now for the AI Arms Race,"Feb 17, 2023",5:05AM,2023-10-14 22:53:16.552979,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/02/17/semiconductor-stock-best-buy-for-ai-arms-race/,"
Big tech escalated the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race at the start of 2023. Microsoft invested in ChatGPT owner OpenAI, Alphabet's Google publicized a countermeasure with the soft launch of Bard, and Meta Platforms said it's revamping its data centers to favor more efficient computing use as it rolls out new AI of its own across its social media apps. 
Behind all of this fancy new AI is an advanced kind of semiconductor system meant to be housed in a remote data center with its computation delivered to users via the internet. In the years to follow, more powerful -- and also more energy efficient -- chips will need to be designed and manufactured. This could make Cadence Design Systems (CDNS -0.77%) a fantastic buy today for this coming wave of AI.

An exceptional 2022
Cadence Design, as well as its peers Synopsys and Mentor (now owned by German industrialist Siemens), have staked a claim in a very important part of the semiconductor market. They provide electronic design automation (EDA) software. Think of it like CAD (computer-aided design), but for chips and computing systems instead of for buildings. 
The proliferation of increasingly complex chips (for phones, laptops, cars, and data centers running AI services and apps) is great news for Cadence and friends. Hardware sales can ebb and flow, making the typical semiconductor stock highly cyclical. But since Cadence is primarily a subscription software business, it provides far more stability and consistency from the multi-decade secular growth trend that is semiconductors. 
2022 was proof of that. Full-year revenue grew 19% to $3.56 billion. Operating profit margin was a very healthy 30% (up from 26% in 2021), or 40% on an adjusted basis (37% in 2021). Free cash flow on the year was $1.12 billion, $1.05 billion of which was used to repurchase stock (about 1.9% of the current market cap, if you're looking for an annualized dividend yield-equivalent to those stock buybacks). 




2022 was a very volatile year for the semiconductor industry. Especially in the second half of the year, supply chains loosened up from their early-pandemic freeze just in time for consumer spending on electronics to falter. Many semiconductor companies have been dealing with contracting sales as a result. 
Not Cadence. It closed out the final quarter of the year with 16% year-over-year growth and is forecasting 13% revenue growth (at the midpoint of guidance) and further profit margin expansion for 2023. This is because, regardless of the end demand for chips and computers, engineers remain at various stages of design for future projects. 
Forget the battle itself, bet on the arms dealer
But what of this AI battle that's brewing among tech giants like Microsoft and Google? Cadence will be a top beneficiary. Besides providing designs for chips, Cadence's software is also used in entire computing system design and verification. In fact, management said on the earnings call that computing system companies (think big tech that operates data centers running AI services like ChatGPT, for example) comprise about 45% of Cadence's total revenue. 
That overall systems design business is a key pillar to Cadence's overall growth profile. Systems revenue increased 27% in 2022 and is expected to continue expanding as a total percentage of revenue in the years ahead.




Why is Cadence so important to companies that are rolling out AI? It's not just optimizing chips to efficiently run an AI system (which consumes significant amounts of energy when generating a response to a user's request). Cadence's software helps automate repetitive tasks, and also generates ideas of its own to help smooth out the development process for engineers. Basically, Cadence offers generative AI that aids in the creation of new generative AI, like what Microsoft and Google are tripping over each other to roll out to the public right now. 
If I can use a military analogy here, don't bet on the armies doing battle when you can bet on the arms dealers -- Cadence, as well as Synopsys. 
Of course, Cadence stock trades at a high premium of 49 times trailing 12-month free cash flow after the final 2022 financial report. Profitability, and especially free cash flow, are expected to rebound in the next year. Cadence was shelling out a high amount of cash in 2022 to support its customers' demands, and as it dealt with industry supply chain restrictions. On an adjusted earnings per share basis (which will more closely follow the pace of free cash flow), Cadence stock trades for 40 times expected 2023 earnings.
By the way, there's upside to Cadence's guidance if management gets confirmation that the current chip slump will bottom by the middle of 2023 (something its semiconductor customers have been saying will happen). 




In short, if chips and AI remain a growth trend for years to come, Cadence deserves the premium price tag. A premium-priced stock is going to include some bouts of turbulence, so I would caution against making one big purchase of the stock. Instead, employ dollar-cost averaging and build up a larger position over time. Nevertheless, Cadence is a wonderful way to invest long-term in the AI arms race.

12,AMAT,1 Stock Showing the Semiconductor Downturn Is Coming to an End,"Aug 25, 2023",5:24PM,2023-10-14 22:53:21.754725,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/08/25/1-stock-showing-the-semiconductor-downturn-is-comi/,"
Shares of Applied Materials (AMAT -2.66%) have been on a tear this year and are approaching all-time highs last reached in late 2021. Investors have been drawn in by the company's winning strategy of steady growth even in a down year for the critical semiconductor-manufacturing equipment niche of the chip market. A big dividend increase announced earlier this year doesn't hurt either. 
However, there's another key reason to be optimistic about Applied's prospects. The company's recent earnings update is the latest sign that a nasty downturn in the semiconductor market (driven by falling consumer electronics sales after the pandemic, which led to excess inventory of some chips) is finally coming to an end. Here's what investors need to know.

A ho-hum quarter... or was it?
Applied Materials Q3 fiscal 2023 (the three months ended in July 2023) looked pretty pedestrian. Revenue was $6.4 billion, down 1% from the year prior. Earnings per share (EPS) were flat from last year at $1.85, or down 2% year over year to $1.90 on an adjusted basis. 
One key financial metric was a standout, though. Free cash flow, which can be highly variable from one quarter and one year to the next, was $2.3 billion. That was up 85% from Q3 fiscal 2022 as past investments into next-gen chip-manufacturing equipment began to pay off.
But what of this semiconductor industry downturn, including for Applied Materials, and the manufacturing-equipment industry's overall decrease in sales in 2023? Applied had some good news tied up in its Q4 outlook (the quarter that will end in October 2023). Management expects revenue to be $6.51 billion, plus or minus $400 million, and adjusted EPS to be $1.82 to $2.18. At the midpoint, that implies a 2% and 5% quarter-over-quarter rise in revenue and adjusted EPS, respectively. 




Things heat up starting in 2024
Business should start to get really interesting starting in 2024. Applied has largely outperformed its peers this year thanks to its pivot to address what it calls ICAPS -- end markets for chips for electric vehicles, industrial automation, solar and wind, and smart-energy infrastructure.
Dozens of new fabs are under construction or retooling right now. Applied, the longtime chipmaking-equipment generalist, will likely sell at least a little equipment to most or all of them. Many of these fabs are for ICAPS but also for advanced logic and memory chips (think PC, smartphone, and data center AI chips). All three of Applied's revenue segments -- Semiconductor Systems (sale of equipment), Applied Global Services (or AGS, equipment leases and servicing, software subscriptions), and Display and Adjacent Markets (LED and OLED display manufacturing equipment) -- are expected to return to strong growth in the coming quarters.
AGS is a good proxy for the trajectory of the business overall, since sales tend to be more stable given the subscription-based model that smooths out the peaks and valleys. CEO Gary Dickerson said on the earnings call that ""we believe we're on track to achieve low double-digit AGS growth in the coming years."" 
Who should be interested in Applied Materials?
Applied is giving a strong signal that the semiconductor industry's broad-based next run higher is right around the corner. If that transpires in 2024, Applied won't be the fastest-growing business. This is more of a slower-and-steady stock play. 




That certainly doesn't mean Applied is a boring stock, though. This company has a long track record of increasing shareholder returns. It raised its quarterly dividend by 23% earlier this year (the dividend currently yields 0.9% a year). Share repurchases have declined in 2023 ($1.5 billion through the first nine months of fiscal 2023 versus $4.6 billion in 2022), but I'm OK with that since the stock was depressed during the 2022 bear market. A shift to more dividend payout instead looks like good capital allocation to me. 
As a result of that cash-allocation adjustment, Applied's balance sheet has been replenished and is ready for the next round of tech investment in the coming years. Cash and short-term investments totaled $6.5 billion at the end of July (plus another $2.2 billion in long-term investments) versus just $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of fiscal 2022 last October. Debt remains stable at $5.5 billion. 
Applied Materials stock still looks attractively valued to me at just shy of 20 times trailing-12-month EPS, or 17 times free cash flow. This remains one of my top semiconductor stocks as the industry approaches its next bull market and could be a good long-term pick for investors seeking growth and income.

13,AMAT,This Cheap Semiconductor Stock Could Be on the Verge of a Turnaround,"Aug 24, 2023",7:21AM,2023-10-14 22:53:22.918206,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/08/24/this-cheap-chip-stock-could-be-a-turnaround-story/,"
Semiconductor stocks are having a great run on the market in 2023, which is evident from the 41% jump in the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index, and this explains why shares of Applied Materials (AMAT -2.66%) have shot up 53% this year despite a decline in the company's revenue and earnings.
The company, known for supplying semiconductor manufacturing equipment to chipmakers and foundries, has struggled due to a big decline in spending in this industry. Gartner estimates that spending on semiconductor capital equipment could decline 22.5% in 2023 to $136 billion, as chipmakers have been pulling back spending on account of an oversupply and a weak macroeconomic scenario.
However, Applied Materials' fiscal 2023 third-quarter results (for the three months ended July 30, 2023), which were released on Aug. 17, suggest that the semiconductor glut may be easing. Let's see why that may be the case.

Applied Materials' fortunes could turnaround soon
Applied Materials reported fiscal Q3 revenue of $6.4 billion, down 1% over the prior-year period. The company's non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings fell 2% from the year-ago period to $1.90 per share last quarter. Wall Street was expecting a bigger decline as analysts would have settled for $1.74 per share in earnings on $6.15 billion in revenue.
The company's revenue and earnings were at the higher end of its guidance range thanks to an improvement in its share in the memory equipment market as well as new opportunities opened by the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). For instance, Applied Materials claims that it has ""gained significant share"" in DRAM (dynamic random access memory) patterning and has become the largest supplier of advanced packaging solutions for high-bandwidth memory (HBM).




These are also the reasons why Applied Materials' guidance for the current quarter turned out to be significantly better than expectations. The company anticipates earnings of $2.00 per share on revenue of $6.51 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter. That would translate into a sequential improvement in the top and bottom lines. What's more, the forecast is significantly better than analysts' expectations of $1.59 per share in earnings on $5.87 billion in revenue.
It is worth noting that spending on semiconductor equipment is expected to increase by 1.3% in 2024, so Applied Materials could return to growth sooner than later. Analysts, for instance, anticipate the company's revenue to start growing in the second half of 2024. With semiconductor capital equipment spending expected to increase by 9.5% in 2025, it won't be surprising to see further acceleration in Applied Materials' growth over the next couple of years.



AMAT Revenue Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YCharts.
But then, don't be surprised to see Applied Materials grow faster than the chart above indicates, as the growing adoption of AI is likely to drive stronger growth in semiconductor capital spending.




AI could be a major long-term catalyst for the company
Applied Materials management discussed in detail on the company's latest earnings conference call how AI could drive greater demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment. For example, the demand for HBM, which is deployed in AI servers, could increase at an annual pace of 30% in the long run.
The company estimates that HBM currently accounts for less than 5% of DRAM capacity. Applied Materials also adds that the die of an HBM is 25% larger than DDR5 DRAM, which means that memory manufacturers will need to upgrade their equipment to meet the growing demand for these chips. Applied Materials expects this potential upgrade to increase its addressable market by 5%.
However, this is just one way in which AI could be a growth driver for the semiconductor industry. Applied Materials estimates that the sector-wide revenue impact of AI, along with IoT, could be worth almost $500 billion through 2030. The company points out that the semiconductor industry generated $573 billion in revenue in 2022, a figure that's expected to jump to $1 trillion by the end of the decade.
The AI chip market alone is expected to hit $227 billion in annual revenue in 2032 as compared to just under $17 billion last year, clocking annual growth of almost 30% over the next decade. All this indicates that Applied Materials' addressable market should ideally keep expanding in the long run, help the company come out of the slump it is in, and deliver robust growth.




Analysts are anticipating Applied Materials' earnings to increase at an annual pace of 12% for the next five years. The catalysts discussed above could help this semiconductor stock clock faster growth, which is why it may be a good time for investors to buy it before it soars higher and becomes expensive. Applied Materials is trading at 20 times trailing earnings right now, a nice discount to the Nasdaq-100 index's price-to-earnings ratio of 30, but it may not be available at such a cheap valuation for long, given the improving sentiments in the semiconductor equipment space.

14,AMAT,"Up 50% in 2023, This Semiconductor Stock Just Showed Why It Has More Upside","Aug 22, 2023",6:52AM,2023-10-14 22:53:24.135034,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/08/22/up-50-in-2023-this-semiconductor-stock-just-showed/,"
The world's largest and most diversified semiconductor equipment company, Applied Materials (AMAT -2.66%), reported earnings last week, showing its resilience to some of the more cyclical elements of the market.
While the chip sector is currently in a downturn -- especially leading-edge chips and memory -- Applied still guided for sequential growth, signaling its very mild dip in revenuE may be over.
In a world of economic turmoil, Applied's resilience could lead to multiple expansion for the stock. If that's the case, then even more upside could be coming, even beyond the 50% gains the stock has already made this year. 

Applied's breadth of products offers an advantage
Because of Applied's diversification across leading-edge and trailing-edge foundry/logic, DRAM and NAND memory, advanced displays, and packaging, the company is able to identify strong growth trends early and invest behind it. That diversification allows Applied to pivot toward higher-growth parts of the chip market and also design co-optimized solutions that include multiple tools. 
For instance, five years ago, management saw the upcoming growth in trailing-edge nodes serving the high-growth auto and Internet of Things industries, which have remained resilient through this downturn. In response, Applied formed a dedicated division it calls its ICAPS group to focus on this segment, introducing 20 products over the past five years. While memory and leading-edge are down significantly this year, the growth of the ICAPS portfolio is now sustaining Applied's equipment sales. 




In addition, Applied has also launched advanced and integrated solutions for DRAM, which is coming out of the memory downturn thanks to the demand for high-bandwidth memory for artificial intelligence. Of note, Applied said its market-share gains in DRAM have come from introducing logic chip characteristics to memory, such as advanced in/out speeds and backside power. So again, this is another example of Applied's diversification advantage, as it seems the company was able to take a technique or learning from one part of chip sector and apply it to innovate another.
Finally, Applied also noted its growth in advanced packaging for heterogeneous integration, a technique required for the ""chiplet"" architecture used in Advanced Micro Devices' upcoming MI300 AI accelerator. Seeing that upcoming need for new packaging techniques for chiplet designs, Applied just introduced five new packaging products in July. 
So even though the overall memory industry is in its worst downturn since the Great Financial Crisis and leading-edge chips, except AI GPUs, are also in a downturn due to the declines in PC and smartphone markets, Applied only saw its equipment sales dip by about 1% last quarter, and forecast sequential growth for its upcoming Q4. That suggests this chip downturn, which is historically bad by some measures, only led to a mild dip in Applied's revenues.

Services add stability to the portfolio
Besides diversified and resilient equipment sales, investors shouldn't overlook Applied's somewhat-recurring services revenue, which made up about 23% of revenue last quarter and actually grew year over year. 




Over the years, Applied has developed services for its installed base that can help machines run more efficiently, lowering defects and increasing yields. Again, this is where Applied's depth and breadth of knowledge is yielding results. While the services segment does include spares and services that are more transactional, management has grown the subscription portion of the services business to over 60%. 
Given that Applied's services revenue is largely tied to its installed base, it's hard to imagine services declining in any one year. The exception was two quarters ago in Applied's fiscal first quarter, which ended in January. But that was the quarter in which the U.S. introduced new rules on selling and servicing advanced memory equipment to China. So, a portion of Applied's tools were taken offline all at once in a one-time event. Yet services revenue began to grow immediately thereafter, growing 3.1% year over year in the recently reported quarter. 
Encouragingly, management noted it expects the global services division to grow double digits annually when the environment normalizes. That recurring and high-profit revenue stream should also bolster future results.
Could boring old stability be a catalyst?
In decades prior, the semiconductor capital equipment sector was very, very cyclical, leading to low multiples across the industry. However, with industry consolidation, diversity beyond PCs and smartphones to IoT, electrification, and AI, and the growth of recurring services tied to the installed base, semicaps generally and Applied specifically appear to be more stable than in years past.




Applied still trades at less than 20 times earnings; but if this mild decline has marked its cyclical bottom, a 20 P/E on bottom-of-the-cycle earnings is still really attractive. Thus, despite strong year-to-date gains, I'd expect Applied stock still has room to run.

16,AMAT,Applied Materials Launches New Chip Equipment and an AI System -- Is the Stock a Buy?,"Jul 16, 2023",8:56AM,2023-10-14 22:53:26.990690,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/07/16/applied-materials-launches-new-chip-equipment-and/,"
After a nasty downturn in 2022, shares of top semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT -2.66%) have rallied over 40% so far in 2023 and are again approaching all-time highs. This in spite of the company reporting stalling sales this year as many of its chip fab (a factory that manufactures chips) customers pause on construction plans to manage their cash flow.  

Investor optimism has been fueled by a coming wave of new chip fabs now under construction, as well as even more existing fab upgrades that will need to be filled with lots of new machinery. To meet growing demands from the semiconductor industry, Applied Materials recently announced new processes, equipment, and a new chipmaking platform. This stock still looks like a buy to me.
More chips, more complexity
Semiconductors are the most complicated manufactured product there is, and the challenges are only getting more complex. The world has an insatiable hunger for silicon as chips are the powerhouse behind literally almost everything these days. Global annual chip sales are expected to reach $1 trillion by the end of this decade (a nearly 70% increase from 2022 levels), and along the way, many of those chips will get more advanced and difficult to make. 
Meanwhile, like other manufacturing industries, chip fabs also have goals to get more efficient -- both for environmental impact reasons, as well as to keep their operating expenses in check to keep fueling higher profitability (thus keeping shareholders happy). 
More chips, more complexity, and more efficient machines are adding fuel to a coming boom in chip fab construction. Industry association SEMI.org has predicted some $500 billion will have been invested in new global fab construction by 2024, propped up by governments around the world interested in solidifying their at-home chipmaking capabilities. Researcher McKinsey thinks $260 billion or more could be invested in chip fabs in the U.S. alone by the end of the decade. 




Applied Materials is the leader in fab equipment, having the broadest portfolio and the highest sales. It may have gone sleepy as of late, but financial results are expected to get cooking in earnest again in 2024.

New machines, and a new machine platform, have arrived
To that end, Applied Materials just announced a number of new processes and equipment that can handle more advanced chips. Specifically, these machines are geared toward what's called ""heterogeneous chip integration"" (or just ""HI""). As the name implies, HI helps manufacturers (and their ultimate customers that need them to build computers and other intelligent devices) combine diverse chips into new packages.  
Sometimes called ""chiplets,"" think of these as Lego pieces that build a more complex chip system, using 2.5D (two or more chips side-by-side on the same substrate) and 3D (two or more chips stacked on top of each other) architecture. This is a departure from traditional monolithic chip architecture, where a single piece of silicon acts as the complete computing circuit.

Perhaps even more significant, though, was the announcement of a new manufacturing platform called Vistara, which the company says is its most significant equipment platform advancement in a decade. Applied touts three major features of Vistara:  

The platform is customizable in different configurations of chambers -- specific types of equipment can be ""plugged in"" to handle the many dozen or sometimes hundreds of steps involved in making a silicon wafer.
Vistara has thousands of sensors that feed into Applied's AI-powered software, which helps customers improve development of new chip recipes, and increase yield and speed of their manufacturing process.
Vistara's footprint is up to 30% smaller than previous platforms, and consumes up to 30% less energy to help fabs reduce their carbon footprint and reduce use of other chemicals needed in the chipmaking process.

Time to buy?
As with any new manufacturing process or equipment, it takes time for these things to trickle down into the fabs of customers. Applied made other equipment announcements early this year, and the story is similar with those machines as well. Perhaps by 2024, there will be significant enough new incremental revenue to report. 
Nevertheless, Applied has been funneling cash into research and development for years, and those efforts are beginning to near fruition. And if Applied's track record holds true, those invested dollars will pay off very well.

Applied Materials stock currently trades for about 20 times trailing-12-month earnings per share, and just under 19 times expected 2024 earnings per share. It looks to me like the market is underestimating the benefit this company will get as all those new fabs being built get filled up with machinery. I remain a buyer of this top player in the semiconductor equipment market.

17,AMAT,Why Applied Materials Rose 48.4% in the First Half of 2023,"Jul 12, 2023",6:36AM,2023-10-14 22:53:28.596667,https://www.fool.com/investing/2023/07/12/why-applied-materials-rose-484-in-the-first-half-o/,"
What happened
Shares of Applied Materials (AMAT -2.66%) rose 48.4% in the first half of 2023, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
It was a very good first half for semiconductor stocks in general, as many sector leaders entered 2023 at depressed levels following the Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes and fears over a potential recession.
Yet while PC and smartphone sales have remained depressed following the pull-forward of demand during the pandemic and weakness in China, trailing-edge chips for electric vehicles and the Internet of Things applications remained strong.
Then in May, blockbuster guidance from Nvidia lit a fire under any chip stock involved in the AI ecosystem. Additionally, the long-feared recession anticipated since last year has thus far failed to materialize.
As the largest (by revenue) and most diverse semiconductor equipment stock, Applied Materials benefited strongly from its exposure to both trailing-edge nodes in the first half of the year as well as AI enthusiasm over the past two months.





So what
In its two earnings reports during the first half of the year, Applied Materials beat analyst expectations on both revenue and earnings per share (EPS), even though growth flatlined. While its fiscal first and second quarters displayed year-over-year growth of 7.5% and 6.2%, respectively, each quarter actually showed small sequential declines. 
Still, it had been known coming into the year that the memory industry was in its worst downturn since the 2008 financial crisis, which would inevitably lead to sharp declines in investment. Meanwhile, the advanced logic sector is also set for year-over-year declines in 2023 amid depressed demand for PCs, smartphones, and non-AI servers. On top of these headwinds, new restrictions on advanced equipment sales to China implemented last October were set to additionally harm growth.
So, Applied entered the year with a depressed price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio around 13, setting it up well for any positive surprises. 
Those surprises came in the form of outperformance in Applied's trailing-edge equipment sales, notably for ion implantation, which actually accelerated even as leading-edge logic and memory-equipment sales declined. The surprising strength was due to Applied having the broadest product portfolio in the semicap equipment industry, insuring a diversity of revenue streams.




Applied's portfolio of course also touches artificial intelligence chips, so Applied got an additional boost following Nvidia's late-May guidance. For leading-edge chips, Applied's core etch and deposition equipment will be a key in the current transition from FinFETs to gate-all-around transistors on upcoming semiconductor nodes.
Applied's diversity and relatively smoother cyclicality than rivals' also allow it to invest in advanced research and development projects. In May, Applied announced the new $4 billion EPIC research and development (R&D) center. EPIC will be a first-of-its-kind center for collaboration among Applied, its logic and memory customers, and leading universities, with the aim of accelerating chip innovation in the years ahead. 
In addition to cutting-edge R&D, Applied's diversity also allows for relatively consistent profits, even in the current down cycle. The bullish profit outlook allowed Applied to raise its dividend 23.1% in March. In addition, management announced it intends to double that dividend over the next few years, along with a $10 billion share-repurchase program.

Now what
It was a great first half for Applied, but of course, this came after the stock's 38.1% decline in 2022. In that light, 2023's outperformance seems like a mere recovery from a particularly bad year. 
While the semiconductor sector is notoriously cyclical and volatile, if an investor can stomach its cycles, the long-term picture looks attractive. Over the past 10 years, Applied is up nearly 900% with dividends included, compared to a mere 223% gain for the S&P 500. Even today, Applied trades at a very reasonable 17.7 times-earnings multiple, still well below the market's multiple of 25.6.
